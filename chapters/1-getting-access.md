Getting Access
==============

Flux, along with the other [HPC Systems](http://cac.engin.umich.edu/resources/systems),
is wrapped up in a metric ton of red tape, which is to say, __getting access is
a time consuming process__. This chapter will walk through the 4 primary steps
required to gain access to: authenticate with, and launch synthesis on, the Flux
login servers. They are:

1. Obtaining an MToken and activating Two Factor Authentication
2. Requsting access to Synopsys
3. Requesting an HPC user account
4. Creating a Flux Allocation


## Useful Contacts
Two HPC members were pivotal to the success of our pilot test during the Winter
2014 term: [Dan Barker](mailto:danbarke@umich.edu) and [Bennet Faube](bennet@umich.edu).

Dan was our first point of contact and took care of setting up our allocation
and adding authorized users. He was extrememly responsive, thorough, and
supportive.

Bennet was our lifeline from HPC and the single reason we were ever able to
complete a synthesis build. Bennet has extensive knowledge of the entire
platform and took care of all the nitty gritty versioning and licensing issues
we faced with Synopsys. __He's the man__.
