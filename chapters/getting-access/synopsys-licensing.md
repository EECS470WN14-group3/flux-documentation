Synopsys Licensing and Access
=============================

In order to use Synopsys on Flux (and off-campus), you must submit an agreement to the
[Synopsys off-campus license terms](http://caen.engin.umich.edu/software/access-to-synopsys-tools).

At the time of writing, this was done using [this Google Doc: https://docs.google.com/a/umich.edu/forms/d/1AGb6w2LbMf5wOI84SRNPEaNOXn76PgeMIp5Qiq1dTzI/viewform](https://docs.google.com/a/umich.edu/forms/d/1AGb6w2LbMf5wOI84SRNPEaNOXn76PgeMIp5Qiq1dTzI/viewform).
If for any reason that link stops working, try the
[Access to Synopsys Tools](http://caen.engin.umich.edu/software/access-to-synopsys-tools)
website, or visit the [CAEN contact page](http://caen.engin.umich.edu/contact).
