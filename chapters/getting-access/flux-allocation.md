Flux Allocation and User Account
================================

To submit jobs on Flux, you'll need an activated HPC user account _and_ an
allocation that lists that account as an authorized user.

### 1. Request an Account
Everyone needs an HPC user account. Request one by
[completing this form](https://www.engin.umich.edu/form/cacaccountapplication)

### 2. For __Students__
Kindly ask your professor to email <hpc-support@umich.edu> to add your account to the access list

### 3. For __Professors__
Request a new allocation by emailing <hpc-support@umich.edu> the following:
- number of cores needed
- start date and duration needed
- list of users that should have access to submit jobs
- list of users that should be admins and able to change user list and allocation properties
- shortcode for funding (current pricing on the [hardware services site](http://arc.research.umich.edu/flux-and-other-hpc-resources/flux/hardware-services/))

__NOTE:__ Most allocation requests require one business day for setup.


## Winter 2014 Pricing Specifics
The following information was provided by [Dan Barker](mailto:danbarke@umich.edu) on April 15, 2014:

> - Flux allocations can only be purchased in month long increments.
> - The cost of a Flux allocation to a member of the College of Engineering is $6.60 per core per month.
> - [We] usually have the cores ready by the next business day after we receive a request.
> - Standard Flux ($11.72/core/month @ 4 GB/core)
> - Big Memory Flux ($23.82/core/month @ 25 GB/core)
> - LSA, CoE, and the Medical School will cost-share 44%, reducing the cost to their researchers to
>   * $6.60/core/month for Standard Flux
>   * $13.30/core/month for Big Memory Flux
> - The allocation [could] take 1-2 business days to set up, so if you specify a start date of today, you may "lose" a day's worth of access.
