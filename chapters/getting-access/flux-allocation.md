Flux Allocation and User Account
================================

To submit jobs on Flux, you'll need an activated HPC user account _and_ an
allocation that lists that account as an authorized user.

## 1. Request an Account
Everyone needs an HPC user account. Request one by
[completing this form](https://www.engin.umich.edu/form/cacaccountapplication)

## 2. For __Students__
Kindly ask your professor to email <hpc-support@umich.edu> to add your account to the access list

## 3. For __Professors__
Request a new allocation by emailing <hpc-support@umich.edu> the following:
- number of cores needed
- start date and duration needed
- list of users that should have access to submit jobs
- list of users that should be admins and able to change user list and allocation properties
- shortcode for funding (current pricing on the [hardware services site](http://arc.research.umich.edu/flux-and-other-hpc-resources/flux/hardware-services/))

Most Flux allocations are created and ready for use within one business day.
